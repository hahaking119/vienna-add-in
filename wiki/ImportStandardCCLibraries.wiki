#summary Import Standard Core Component Libraries

=Standard CC Libraries=

At (3), several versions of the standard Core Component Libraries (CCL) are available for download. The VIENNA Add-In helps you to automatically download these standard Core Component Libraries and import them into a UPCC model.

=Import standard CC Libraries into an existing UPCC3 model=

  # Prepare an Enterprise Architect model and set it as UPCC3 model
  # In the _Project Browser_, select the model and right-click on the bLibrary
  # Select _Add-In / VIENNAAddIn / Import Standard CC Libraries_ from the context menu:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/ImportStandardCCLibraries_01.gif
  # In the _Standard Core Component Library Importer_ dialog, you can choose the desired version of the CCL from two drop-down lists
  # After choosing the CCL version, detailed information to the selected version is shown in the _Comments_ section:

  # Finally, click _Import_
  # If there are existing libraries in the current project with the same name as the Core Components Libraries, you will need to confirm that these old liberaries may be overwritten:

  # The Add-In will now download the Core Component Libraries as XMI files and import them into the current project
  # You can observe the import process by watching the status messages that are printed to the _Status_ section regularly:
