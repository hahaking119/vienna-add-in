#summary Storyboard for modeling typical Passport Information using the VIENNA Add-In.

= Passport Modeling Storyboard =

Imagine two organisations that are planning to exchange information electronically, for example human passport data. They decide to use Core Components for creating a sample model for this passport information. The two parties must agree on which information is included in the passport model and how this information is organised.

This sample scenario shows how to create such a sample passport model using Enterprise Architect and the VIENNA Add-In in three steps. Sample images are included, as well as video tutorials.

Start with [PassportModelStep1 Passport Model - Step 1] to see how to create the basic EA model needed for the passport information.
