#summary Storyboard for modeling typical Passport Information using the VIENNA Add-In.

= Passport Modeling Storyboard =

Imagine two organisations that are planning to exchange information electronically, for example human passport data. They decide to use Core Components for creating a sample model for this passport information. The two parties must agree on which information is included in the passport model and how this information is organised.

This sample scenario shows how to create such a sample passport model using Enterprise Architect and the VIENNA Add-In in three steps. Sample images are included, as well as video tutorials.

Start with [PassportModelStep1 Passport Model - Step 1] to see how to open an Enterprise Architect project file, create a UPCC model and import the standard libraries needed for Core Component compliance.
[PassportModelStep2 Passport Model - Step 2] explains which ABIE elements are needed for modeling the passport data and how they are created.
Finally, [PassportModelStep3 Passport Model - Step 3] illustrates how to combine these elements in order to create a complete business document.
