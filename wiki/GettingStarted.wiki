  # Select main menu: [Add-Ins]/[VIENNAAddIn]/[Set Model as UMM2/UPCC3 Model]
  # Select main menu: [Add-Ins]/[VIENNAAddIn]/[Create initial UPCC3 model structure]

In the dialog, you can choose the libraries to create and whether to import the standard CCL libraries (see below).

Click [Generate Default Model] to create the model structure.

==Importing standard libraries==

  # Select "Import standard CC Libraries"
  # Choose a version of the CCL.

The Add-In will then download the CLL libraries as XMI files and import them into the current project.
