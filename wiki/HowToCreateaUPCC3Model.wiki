The process of generating the model structure will take some time, you can observe this process by watching the status messages that are printed to the "status" field regularly.

If you did not import the standard CC libraries through the Default UPCC Model Creator, you can do that later using the Standard CCL Importer.

  # In the _Project Browser_, select the model and right-click on the bLibrary
  # Select _Add-In / VIENNAAddIn / Import Standard CC Libraries_ from the context menu:
    TODO img 12
  # In the _Standard Core Component Library Importer_ dialog, you can choose the desired version of the CCL from two drop-down lists
  # After choosing the CCL version, detailed information to the selected version is shown in the _Comments_ section:
    TODO img 13
  # Finally, click _Import_
  # The Add-In will now download the Core Component Libraries as XMI files and import them into the current project
  # You can observe the import process by watching the status messages that are printed to the _Status_ section regularly:
