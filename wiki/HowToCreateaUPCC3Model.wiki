=How To Create a UPCC3 Model=

This tutorial explaines how to create a new model according to the UPCC3 standard in a step-wise manner.

==Create a new project==

  # From the main menu, select _File / New Project..._ and choose the directory and filename for storing the project:
    TODO img 20
  # In the _Select model(s)_ dialog, select none of the check boxes and click _OK_:

  # Set the model as a UPCC3 Model by selecting _Add-Ins / VIENNAAddIn / Set Model as UMM2/UPCC3 Model_ from the main menu:
    TODO img 1

==Generate a default UPCC Model==

  # In the _Project Browser_, right-click on the newly created model
  # Select _Add-In / VIENNAAddIn / Create initial UPCC3 model structure_ from the context menu:
    TODO img 3
  # In the _Default UPCC Model Creator_ dialog, you can choose a name to be assigned to the new model:
    TODO img 5
  # Usually, default names are assigned to the libraries generated as members of the new model. If you want to assign custom names to some of the libraries, uncheck the _Use default names for generated Libraries_ checkbox and change the library names:
    TODO img 6
  # After unchecking _Use default names for generated Libraries_, you can also uncheck all libraries you do not want to be generated automatically
  # When selecting the _Import standard CC libraries_ checkbox, the Add-In will automatically download the standard Core Component Libraries an import them into the newly created model. If you decide not to use this functionality at the moment, you can import the CC Libraries later using the Standard CC Library Importer - see section _Import standard Core Component Libraries_ for details!
   # When using the automatic CCL import functionality, you can choose the desired version of the CCL from two drop-down lists
   # After choosing the CCL version, detailed information to the selected version is shown in the _Comments_ section
     TODO img 7
  # Finally, click _Generate Default Model_
  # You can observe process of model generation by watching the status messages that are printed to the _Status_ section regularly. After the process has been finished, a message box confirms that the model has been created successfully:

==Import standard Core Component Libraries==

If you did not import the standard CC libraries through the Default UPCC Model Creator, you can do that later using the Standard CCL Importer.

  # In the _Project Browser_, select the model and right-click on the bLibrary
  # Select _Add-In / VIENNAAddIn / Import Standard CC Libraries_ from the context menu:
    TODO img 12
  # In the _Standard Core Component Library Importer_ dialog, you can choose the desired version of the CCL from two drop-down lists
  # After choosing the CCL version, detailed information to the selected version is shown in the _Comments_ section:
    TODO img 13
  # Finally, click _Import_
  # If there are existing libraries in the current project with the same name as the Core Components Libraries, you will need to confirm that these old liberaries may be overwritten:
    TODO img 16
  # The Add-In will now download the Core Component Libraries as XMI files and import them into the current project
  # You can observe the import process by watching the status messages that are printed to the _Status_ section regularly:
