#summary Outline for a VIENNA Add-In Tool Presentation

= Storyboard =

1. Create New Project

2. Set model as UMM2/UPCC3 model

2. Use Add-in Wizard to create initial model structure

3. Show the UML Profile for Core Components - explain the dynamic loading mechanism for MDG

Elaborate on the advantages of the UML profile:

a) Constant access to the most recent version of the UPCC - bugfixes in the profile are automatically loaded into EA

b) Automatic generation of necessary attributes (tagged values)

3. Create sample artifacts using the UML Profile for Core Components

a) Create a CDT "Text"

b) Create an ACC "Address".

c) Add BCCs

d) Set the BCC type

e) Set unique identifier, DEN, definition etc.

4. Validate the sample artifacts

5. Open existing sample model with CCTS structures

5. Create ABIE using Add-in Wizard based on existing ACCs and BCCs

6. Create business document based on ABIEs

7. Validate the existing model libraries

8. Generate XSD Schemas from DOCLibrary
