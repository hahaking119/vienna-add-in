#summary Outline for a VIENNA Add-In Tool Presentation

= Storyboard =

1. Create New Project

2. Set model as UMM2/UPCC3 model

2. Use Add-in Wizard to create initial model structure

3. Show the UML Profile for Core Components - explain the dynamic loading mechanism for MDG

Elaborate on the advantages of the UML profile:

-) Constant access to the most recent version of the UPCC - bugfixes in the profile are automatically loaded into EA

-) Automatic generation of necessary attributes (tagged values)

3. Create sample artifacts using the UML Profile for Core Components

-) Create a CDT "Text"

-) Create an ACC "Address".

-) Add BCCs

-) Set the BCC type

-) Set unique identifier, DEN, definition etc.

4. Validate the sample artifacts

5. Open existing sample model with CCTS structures

6. Create a new and empty BIELibrary

5. Create ABIE using Add-in Wizard based on existing ACCs and BCCs - Select the newly created BIELibrary as target

6. Create business document based on ABIEs

7. Validate the existing model libraries

8. Generate XSD Schemas from DOCLibrary
