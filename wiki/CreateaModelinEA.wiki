#summary Create a model in EA

=Enterprise Architect=

The UML Profile for Core Components is a representation of UN/CEFACTâ€™s Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS) 3.0 in UML. The UML Profile for Core Components (UPCC) is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and defined as a profile on top of it. To model business documents in EA following the UPCC standard, the model must be defined as a UPCC3 model, and must contain certain libraries defined in the UPCC3 standard.
