#summary Create your own ABIEs

=Aggregate Business Information Entities=

Every Aggregate Business Information Entity (ABIE) is based on an Aggregated Core Component (ACC). When creating a new ABIE, this ABIE is derivated from an ACC by specifying which attributes and associations of the ACC should be inherited by the ABIE. The VIENNA Add-In provides the _ABIE Editor_ dialog for creating new ABIEs based on specific ACCs.

=Create ABIEs=

  # Prepare a UPCC3 model in Enterprise Architect
  # In the _Project Browser_, select the model and right-click on the BIELibrary
  # Select _Add-In / VIENNAAddIn / Create new ABIE_ from the context menu:

  # The _ABIE Editor_ dialog provides all options available for creating ABIEs:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownAbies_02.gif
  # First, you have to decide which ACC the new ABIE should be based on. From the first drop down list, select the CC Library the chosen ACC is located in. Then, you can select the desired ACC from the second drop down list.
  # After selecting an ACC, all potential attributes and associations the ACC contains are shown in the center of the dialog

  # In the _Attributes_ section, you can decide which Basic Business Information Entities (BBIEs) the new ABIE should contain.
  # In the first column, select all Basic Core Components (BCCs) that should be added to the ABIE as BBIEs.
  # For each BCC selected in the first column, the second and third columns show which  BBIEs will be created based on this BCC, and which Business Data Type (BDT) will be used to typify this BBIE:

  # In the second column, you can rename BBIES by simply selecting the describing text and entering a new name:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownAbies_05.gif
  # In addition, it is possible to add new BBIEs by clicking the _+_ button:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownAbies_06.gif
  # The same applies to the third column: You can rename BDTs as well as create new ones:

    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownAbies_08.gif
  # The section _Associations_ shows all existing ABIEs that can be associated with the new one. You can select the ABIEs you want to associate from the first column, and for each of those ABIE you can select the Association Business Information Entities (ASBIEs) that should be used from the second column:

  # Each CDT contains exactly one Content Component that is already selected, therefore you cannot change the selection in the _CON_ list:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownBdts_03.gif
  # From the _SUP_ list, you can select all Supplementary Components the BDT should contain:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownBdts_04.gif
  # Enter a name and a prefix fot the BDT to be created:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownBdts_05.gif
  # Select the BDT Library the new BDT should be located in from the drop down list at the bottom of the dialog
  # Finally, clickt the _Create BDT_ button:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownBdts_06.gif
  # After the BDT was created successfully, a confirmation message is shown:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateyourownBdts_08.gif


If a BDT with the desired name exists already, a warning will be displayed:
