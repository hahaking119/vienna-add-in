# Introduction #
The [Research Studio](http://www.ffg.at/content.php?cid=784) Public Private Interoperability ([PPI](http://ios.researchstudio.at/rd/rd_de.html)) develops methods and tools targeting the inter-organizational integration of enterprises and organizations of the public sector. Service-oriented architectures and their implementation by Web Services are the current state-of-the-art technologies for this kind of integration problems. However, Web Services are agnostic toward the structure of the information / documents being exchanged. The studio PPI focuses on the exchanged business documents and considers a model-driven approach for the definition of the interfaces. The resulting method and a corresponding tool set have to provide a mix between re-usable document building blocks and business context specific adaptation of business documents. The method must not be limited to a single business document standard language or business document ontology. PPI delivers concepts for the platform-independent definition of business documents as well as for the transformation between different business document standards / ontologies. Evidently, PPI integrates existing, well accepted business document standards, like UBL 2.0, into its prototypical implementation of a tool set. The re-engineering of existing business document standards will reduce time and costs in the development of new business interoperability interfaces and will allow the platform-specific transformation between business document standards.

The VIENNA Add-In (Visualizing Inter ENterprise Network Architectures) is an extension to the UML modeling tool [Enterprise Architect](http://www.sparxsystems.com.au) for modeling B2B collaborations.

The development of the VIENNA Add-In is currently carried out in the Public Private Interoperability (PPI) project of the Research Studio Inter Organisational Systems ([IOS](http://ios.researchstudio.at/)). In the following video the benefits of using our Core Components approach are illustrated.

## Overview ##
Using the two technologies a business process modeler can unambiguously define inter-organizational business processes and business documents on a technology independent level. The platform independent models may be used to derive platform specific artifacts for service oriented architectures e.g. BPEL, WSDL, XSD.

The VIENNA Add-In supports UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology (UMM) and the UML Profile for Core Components (UPCC).

More information on the UMM and UPCC standard can be found on the development site http://www.umm-dev.org

# Documentation #
See our [Getting Started](http://code.google.com/p/vienna-add-in/wiki/GettingStarted) guide for instructions on how to use the VIENNA Add-In. We also provide a sample scenario, the [Passport Modeling Example](http://code.google.com/p/vienna-add-in/wiki/PassportModelStep0) to demonstrate important features.
If you are experienced with UML modeling but never used Enterprise Architect before have a look at our [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/vienna-add-in/wiki/EnterpriseArchitect).

The VIENNA Add-In is Open Source! Developers are welcome to participate - information on the developement process is available at the [Developer infos](http://code.google.com/p/vienna-add-in/wiki/ForDevelopers) section in our wiki.

# Publications #
An overview of current publications in the scope of our project is available [here](http://code.google.com/p/vienna-add-in/wiki/PublicationsPPI). These papers include further information on the development and basic principles of the VIENNA Add-In project.
