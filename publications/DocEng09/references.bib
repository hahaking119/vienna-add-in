	Such revalidation algorithms have applications in schema evolution,

	We describe how knowledge of conformance to an XML Schema may be
	used to determine conformance to another XML Schema efficiently.
	We examine both the situation where an XML document is modified before
	it is revalidated and the situation where it is unmodified},
