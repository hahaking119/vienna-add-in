The VIENNA Add-In (Visualizing Inter ENterprise Network Architectures) is an extension to the UML modeling tool [Enterprise Architect](http://www.sparxsystems.com.au) for modeling B2B collaborations.

Using the two technologies a business process modeler can unambiguously define inter-organizational business processes and business documents on a technology independent level. The platform independent models may be used to derive platform specific artifacts for service oriented architectures e.g. BPEL, WSDL, XSD.

The VIENNA Add-In supports UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology (UMM) and the UML Profile for Core Components (UPCC).

More information on the UMM and UPCC standard can be found on the development site http://www.umm-dev.org
