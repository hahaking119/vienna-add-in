The following changes have been made to the original ebInterface
MapForce files in order to get them through the importer:

  "InvoiceRecipient" and "OrderingParty".

General notes:
==============

1) Elements must be expanded in order to be included in the MapForce
   mapping file. This is important for:

   a) Attaching sub-trees to the main source tree.

   b) Deriving mappings for complex elements in cases where the
      element's complex type is mapped elsewhere.
